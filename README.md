# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository!

I am a unix System Administrator with an interest in learning.  I've been in the IT industry (in one capacity or another) since about 1992.

Many times I will be interested in a programming language and I will want to write something.  When that happens, I want a place where I can share programs and snippets.  That's where GitHub comes in.  :)
